# Case Study on OpenAI and Sora

Hello, I'm Michael Leston - a brand new programmer. I will be presenting a case
study on OpenAI with a specific focus on Sora, their text-to-video model.

## Overview and Origin

* OpenAI Inc was founded in December 2015.

### Founding Members:

    - Greg Brockman
    - Ilya Sutskever
    - Trevor Blackwell
    - Vicki Cheung
    - Andrej Karpathy
    - Durk Kingma
    - John Schulman
    - Pamela Vagata
    - Wojciech Zaremba

### Founding Board Co-Chairs

    - Sam Altman
    - Elon Musk

### Company History

* OpenAI received principal funding from notables including Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffmann, and Jessica Livingston.

* Originally founded as a non-profit with the goal to "...advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole..."[^1], OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit in 2019 and has undergone multiple changes in board members and has seen the departure of certain founding members.  

* With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, OpenAI has become one of the most well known artificial intelligence companies. OpenAI has developed research projects involved with reinforcement learning, generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs), code generators, text-to-image, and speech-to-text models. ChatGPT boasts 180 millions user and monthly visit totals to ChatGPT have grown from 266 million in December 2022 to 1.8 billion in March 2024.[^2]

### Landscape

* OpenAI has been one of the leaders of generative AI race, utilizing increased GPU power as well as new developments in deep learning, neural networks, diffusion models, transformer architectures. ChatGPT, originally described as an LLM (Large Language Model) could now be called a **multimodal** model (LMM perhaps?) due to its use of various data types  on top of just text.

* Big tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Apple are strong competitors in the field of AI. OpenAI has partnered with Microsoft and worked with NVidia - other tech giants.

## Sora

Although OpenAI boasts many products and applications, we'll be looking specifically at Sora.

* What is Sora? Sora is a generative ai model, specifically a **denoising latent diffusion model**, specializing in text-to-video. As of May 16, 2024 Sora is not yet available to the public.

* Sora uses *patches* for models of visual data instead of *tokens* used by LLMs.  

* Sora incorporates ChatGPT to expand user prompts into more robust descriptions for accurate output in the form of high quality video.

## Impact

* Although Sora remains unavailable to the public, the response to the video demos released in February 2024 has been impactful. Many news articles and videos were published with varying praise and critique of Sora's capabilities.[^3] 

>"Sora Is Going to Change Hollywood, but Hollywood Needs to Have Final Cut"[^4]

* Sora undoubtedly will affect all visual media fields such as: news media, filmmaking, television and streaming services, social media apps like TikTok and Snapchat, video focused websites like YouTube and Vimeo - as well as having uses in advertising/marketing, AI assisted teaching and education, gaming, writing, and many others areas.

* On May 14, 2024 Google announced Veo, their newest generative video model and direct competitor to Sora. Other generative video models include (but not are not limited to):

    1. Google's [Imagen Video](https://imagen.research.google/video/), [Phenaki](https://phenaki.video/), and [Lumiere](https://lumiere-video.github.io/)
    2. Meta's [Make-A-Video](https://makeavideo.studio/)
    3. Runway's [Gen-2](https://research.runwayml.com/gen2)

## Recommendations

* I would recommend OpenAI use Sora to produce educational content and assist educators in the learning process. Specialized content videos for students as well as teachers could streamline and improve current methods. This would also align with OpenAI's original goal to benefit humanity. They could also alleviate concerns with deepfakes, copyright infringement, nsfw content, and the use of misaligned artificial intelligence. 

* While OpenAI does offer tutorials, their role in education seems to have dropped well behind [Grow with Google](https://grow.google/) and others like [DataRobot](https://learn.datarobot.com/).
