Hello, I'm Michael Leston - a brand new programmer. I will be presenting a case
study on OpenAI with a specific focus on Sora, their text-to-video model.

## Overview and Origin

* OpenAI Inc was founded in December 2015.

### Founding Members:

- Greg Brockman

- Trevor Blackwell
- Vicki Cheung

### Company History

* OpenAI received principal funding from notables including Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Reid Hoffmann, and Jessica Livingston.

* Originally founded as a non-profit with the goal to "...advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole..."[^1], OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit in 2019 and has undergone multiple changes in board members and has seen the departure of certain founding members.  

* With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, OpenAI has become one of the most well known artificial intelligence companies. Monthly visit totals to ChatGPT have gromwn from 266 million in December 2022 to 1.8 billion in March 2024.[^2]

### Landscape

* OpenAI has been one of the leaders of generative AI race.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* Big tech companies like Google, Meta, Amazon, and Apple are strong competitors in the field of AI. OpenAI has partnered with Microsoft and worked with NVidia, other tech giants.

## Sora

Although OpenAI boasts many products and applications, we'll be looking specifically at Sora.

* What is Sora? Sora is a generative ai model, specifically a **denoising latent diffusion model**, specializing in text-to-video. As of May 16, 2024 Sora is not yet available to the public.

* Sora uses *patches* for models of visual data instead of *tokens* used by LLMs.  

* Sora incorporates ChatGPT to expand user prompts into more robust descriptions for more accurate output as high quality video.

## Impact

* Although Sora remains unavailable to the public, the response to the video demos released in February 2024 has been impactful. Many news articles and videos were published with varying praise and critique of Sora's capabilities.[^3] 

* On May 14, 2024 Google announced Veo, their newest generative video model and direct competitor to Sora. Other generative video models include (but not are not limited to):

1. Google's [Imagen Video](https://imagen.research.google/video/), [Phenaki](https://phenaki.video/), and [Lumiere](https://lumiere-video.github.io/)
2. Meta's [Make-A-Video](https://makeavideo.studio/)
3. Runway's [Gen-2](https://research.runwayml.com/gen2)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
