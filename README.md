* With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, OpenAI has become one of the most well known artificial intelligence companies. Monthly visit totals to ChatGPT have gromwn from 266 million in December 2022 to 1.8 billion in March 2024.[^2]

## Sora

Although OpenAI boasts many products and applications, we'll be looking specifically at Sora.

* What is Sora? Sora is a generative ai model, specifically a **denoising latent diffusion model**, specializing in text-to-video. As of May 16, 2024 Sora is not yet available to the public.

* Sora uses *patches* for models of visual data instead of *tokens* used by LLMs.  

* Sora incorporates ChatGPT to expand user prompts into more robust descriptions for more accurate output as high quality video.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Impact

* Although Sora remains unavaibable, the response to the video demos released in February 2024 has been enormous.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
